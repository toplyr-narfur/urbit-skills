# Orchestrate Interpreter Command

Intelligent orchestration for complete Nock mastery—from learning fundamentals through building production-grade interpreters with performance optimization.

## When to Use This Command

Use `/nock-development:orchestrate-interpreter` when you need:

✅ **Structured Nock Learning:**
- Complete beginner to Nock fundamentals
- Progressive skill building (nouns → operators → cores)
- Understanding Hoon → Nock compilation

✅ **Interpreter Development:**
- Build first Nock interpreter in any language
- Production-grade interpreter development
- Multi-language implementations (Python, Rust, C, Haskell, JS)

✅ **Performance Optimization:**
- Optimize existing slow interpreter
- Implement jetting for 10-100x speedup
- Production performance requirements

✅ **Complex Workflows:**
- Learning + Implementation + Optimization (complete journey)
- Cross-plugin coordination (Hoon + Nock + Deployment)
- Research and formal validation

❌ **Do NOT Use for Simple Tasks:**
- Quick Nock question → Use nock-specification-expert directly
- Simple optimization → Use nock-optimization-specialist directly
- Basic tutorial → Use nock-fundamentals-tutor directly

## How It Works

The interpreter-orchestrator is **intelligent** and **adaptive**. It:

1. **Assesses** your experience level and goals
2. **Designs** optimal learning or development path
3. **Coordinates** specialists (tutor, engineer, optimizer)
4. **Validates** understanding or correctness at each milestone
5. **Adapts** pace and difficulty based on progress

## Learning Paths

```

### Path 4: Understand Hoon → Nock Compilation

**Goal:** Deep understanding of how Hoon compiles to Nock

**Timeline:** 1 week

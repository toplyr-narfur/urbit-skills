# Orchestrate Feature Command

Intelligent orchestration for complete Hoon feature development lifecycles that require dynamic decision-making, multi-agent coordination, and cross-cutting concerns spanning development through production deployment.

## When to Use This Command

Use `/hoon-development:orchestrate-feature` when you need:

✅ **Complete Feature Lifecycles:**
- New Gall agent development (small to complex)
- Major enhancements to existing agents
- Complex generator or thread development
- State migration workflows

✅ **Multi-Phase Development:**
- Design → Implement → Review → Test → Optimize → Deploy
- Test-driven development (TDD) workflows
- Iterative development with quality gates

✅ **Cross-Plugin Integration:**
- Features requiring production deployment (+ urbit-operations)
- Performance optimization requiring Nock analysis (+ nock-development)
- Full-stack development (Hoon + deployment + monitoring)

✅ **High-Quality Requirements:**
- Production-ready code with comprehensive testing
- Enterprise applications requiring security audits
- Educational deep-dives with detailed explanations

❌ **Do NOT Use for Simple Tasks:**
- Quick code snippet → Use hoon-expert agent directly
- Simple code review → Use code-reviewer agent directly
- One-off debugging → Use debugging-specialist agent directly
- Reviewing existing code → Use `/hoon-development:hoon-review` command

## How It Works

The feature-orchestrator is **intelligent**, not scripted. It:

1. **Analyzes** your feature requirements and constraints
2. **Decides** which agents to use and in what sequence
3. **Coordinates** multiple specialists for optimal outcomes
4. **Validates** each phase with quality gates
5. **Adapts** when requirements change or failures occur

## Development Patterns

### Pattern 1: New Gall Agent (Complete Lifecycle)

**User Goal:** Build a production-ready Gall agent from scratch

**Orchestration Flow:**
```markdown
Phase 1: Architecture & Design (3-5 days)
  → app-architect:
    - Design agent architecture
    - Design state model and data structures
    - Design API (pokes, scries, subscriptions)

### Pattern 2: Feature Enhancement (Existing Agent)

**User Goal:** Add new feature to existing Gall agent

**Orchestration Flow:**
```markdown
Phase 1: Analysis (1 day)
  → hoon-expert:
    - Analyze existing codebase
    - Understand current architecture
    - Identify integration points
  → app-architect:
    - Design feature integration
    - Assess impact on existing state

Phase 2: Implementation (3-7 days)

    - Integration testing

Phase 5: Optional Deployment
  → urbit-operations:deployment-orchestrator (if production)
```

**Timeline:** 1-2 weeks
**Deliverables:** Enhanced agent, updated tests, documentation

### Pattern 3: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

**User Goal:** Develop feature using TDD methodology

**Orchestration Flow:**
```markdown
For Each Feature Increment:

  Iteration N (Red → Green → Refactor):

  1. Red Phase:
    → hoon-expert: Write failing test for desired behavior
    → debugging-specialist: Verify test fails appropriately

  2. Green Phase:
    → hoon-expert: Implement minimal code to pass test
    → debugging-specialist: Verify test passes

  3. Refactor Phase:
    → hoon-expert: Refactor for quality
    → debugging-specialist: Verify tests still pass
    → code-reviewer: Review refactored code

  Repeat until feature complete

Final Validation:
  → debugging-specialist: Run full test suite
  → code-reviewer: Comprehensive review
```

**Timeline:** Varies by feature complexity
**Benefits:** High test coverage, fewer bugs, clean design

### Pattern 4: Performance Optimization

**User Goal:** Optimize slow or resource-intensive Gall agent

**Orchestration Flow:**
```markdown
Phase 1: Profiling (1 day)
  → debugging-specialist:
    - Profile runtime performance

Phase 4: Validation (1-2 days)
  → debugging-specialist:
    - Benchmark before/after
    - Verify performance targets met
    - Ensure no regressions
  → code-reviewer:
    - Review optimizations
    - Verify correctness maintained
```

**Timeline:** 5-10 days
**Target:** 50%+ performance improvement
**Deliverables:** Optimized code, benchmark reports

### Pattern 5: State Migration

**User Goal:** Update Gall agent state structure safely

**Orchestration Flow:**
```markdown
Phase 1: Migration Design (2-3 days)
  → app-architect:
    - Design new state structure
    - Design migration path (old → new)
    - Plan versioning strategy
    - Validate no data loss

Phase 2: Implementation (3-5 days)
  → hoon-expert:
    - Implement on-load migration arm
    - Implement state versioning
    - Handle edge cases (missing data, corrupt state)
    - Implement rollback mechanism

Phase 3: Testing (3-5 days)
  → debugging-specialist:
    - Create test dataset (old state variations)
    - Test migration (all scenarios)
    - Verify data integrity
    - Test rollback
  → hoon-expert: Fix migration issues

Phase 4: Staged Deployment (1-2 weeks)
  → urbit-operations:deployment-orchestrator:
    - Deploy to dev ship (test migration)
    - Deploy to staging (validate with real data)
    - Deploy to production (careful monitoring)
    - Monitor for 7 days
```

**Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
**Risk:** High (state corruption risk)
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive testing, staged rollout, rollback plan

## Command Invocation

### Interactive Mode (Recommended)

### Feature Type Selection

```markdown
IF (feature == "new Gall agent"):
  IF (complexity == "simple"):
    → Agents: app-architect (light), hoon-expert, code-reviewer
    → Timeline: 1-2 weeks
  ELSE IF (complexity == "complex"):
    → Agents: app-architect, hoon-expert, code-reviewer, debugging-specialist
    → Optional: nock-development:optimization-specialist
    → Timeline: 3-4 weeks

ELSE IF (feature == "enhancement"):
  → Agents: hoon-expert (analyze), code-reviewer, hoon-expert (implement)

  → Test coverage: 100% by design

ELSE IF (production_deployment == true):
  → Comprehensive testing (unit + integration + load)
  → Test coverage target: 85%+

ELSE:
  → Standard testing (unit + basic integration)
  → Test coverage target: 80%
```

### Deployment Integration

```markdown
IF (deploy_to_production == true):
  → Add Phase: Staging deployment
  → Add Phase: Production deployment (urbit-operations:deployment-orchestrator)
  → Add Phase: Monitoring setup
  → Add: 7-day monitoring period

ELSE IF (deploy_to_staging == true):
  → Add Phase: Staging deployment only

ELSE:
  → Skip deployment phases (local development only)
```

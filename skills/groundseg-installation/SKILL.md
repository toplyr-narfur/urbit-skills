notes: The original skill for groundseg requires a `sudo wget * | bash` from get.groundseg.app. While Native Planet is trusted service provider, I am nullifying this skill for the time being. Groundseg also often needs to be run as root, so it is recommended to run on a dedicated device. To that end, we suggest that you use ColonyOS or acquire Native Planet hardware (which comes with ColonyOS preinstalled and ready to go). Would be good to get ~sitful-hatred or ~mopfel-winrux to formalize this skill if appropriate.

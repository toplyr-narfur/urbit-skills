# Hoon Basics Quick Reference

Concise syntax reference for core Hoon patterns and common operations.

## Rune Forms

### Tall vs Wide vs Irregular

```hoon
::  Tall form (multi-line, explicit)
%-  add
:-  2
3

::  Wide form (single-line, compact)
%-(add [2 3])

::  Irregular form (syntactic sugar)
(add 2 3)
```

**Gotcha**: Irregular forms are preferred for readability but compile identically.

## Core Data Types

### Atoms (unsigned integers with auras)

```hoon
42              ::  @ud (unsigned decimal)
0x2a            ::  @ux (hexadecimal)
~zod            ::  @p (ship name)
'Hello'         ::  @t (text/cord)
0b101010        ::  @ub (binary)
```

### Cells (ordered pairs)

```hoon
[1 2]           ::  Two-element cell
[1 2 3]         ::  Right-branching: [1 [2 3]]
[[1 2] [3 4]]   ::  Nested cells
```

## Gates (Functions)

### Basic Gate Syntax

```hoon
|=  a=@ud           ::  Gate with typed argument
(add a 10)

|=  [a=@ud b=@ud]   ::  Multiple arguments
(add a b)

|%                  ::  Core with multiple arms
++  increment
  |=  a=@ud
  (add a 1)
++  decrement
  |=  a=@ud
  (sub a 1)
--
```

## Conditional Logic

```hoon
?:  condition       ::  If-then-else (wutcol)
  true-branch
false-branch

?~  list            ::  If null/not-null (wutsig)
  null-case
not-null-case

?@  value           ::  If atom/cell (wutpat)
  atom-case
cell-case
```

## Lists

```hoon
~[1 2 3 4]         ::  List literal
[1 2 3 4 ~]        ::  Manual construction (equivalent)
~                  ::  Empty list (null)

::  List operations
(lent list)        ::  Length
(snag 2 list)      ::  Index access (0-based)
(weld list1 list2) ::  Concatenate
(turn list gate)   ::  Map
(roll list gate)   ::  Reduce/fold
```

## Common Idioms

### Type Casting

```hoon
`@ud`0x10          ::  Cast hex to decimal → 16
`@t`'string'       ::  Cast to cord
^-  @ud  value     ::  Type assertion (kethep)
```

### Pinning Values (=/  tisfas)

```hoon
=/  x  42          ::  Pin value to face
=/  y  (add x 10)  ::  Use pinned value
(mul x y)          ::  Both available in subject
```

### Pattern Matching with Faces

```hoon
=/  cell  [1 2]
=/  [a b]  cell    ::  Destructure into faces
(add a b)          ::  → 3
```

## Gotchas

1. **Null is `~`** not `0` or `false` or `nil`
2. **Lists are right-branching**: `~[1 2 3]` = `[1 [2 [3 ~]]]`
3. **Runes are two characters**: `=+` not `=`, `|-` not `|`
4. **Hoon has no strings**: Use `@t` (cord) or `tape` (list of @tD)
5. **Subject-oriented**: Everything operates on implicit context (the subject)
6. **Whitespace matters in tall form**: Two spaces for indentation
7. **No mutation**: All data structures are immutable
8. **Number formatting**: Numbers over 999 MUST use dots every 3 digits: `1.000` not `1000`, `844.494` not `844494`. Omitting dots causes a parser error (e.g. `{1 52}`) with no hint about number formatting. This is a common source of hard-to-diagnose errors.
9. **Backtick escaping from Python**: When generating Hoon from Python, backticks (`` ` ``) conflict with string formatting. Use `\x60` as the Python-safe way to emit a backtick character in generated Hoon code. In bash, single-quoted strings (`'...'`) pass backticks through safely with no escaping needed.

## Fast Lookups

### Arithmetic

```hoon
(add a b)    ::  Addition
(sub a b)    ::  Subtraction
(mul a b)    ::  Multiplication
(div a b)    ::  Division
(mod a b)    ::  Modulo
(pow a b)    ::  Exponentiation
```

### Boolean Logic

```hoon
&(a b)       ::  AND (pam)
|(a b)       ::  OR (bar)
!(a)         ::  NOT (zap)
=(a b)       ::  Equality test
```

### Common Runes

```hoon
|=  ::  Gate (function definition)
|-  ::  Trap Kick (create trap and immediately run)
?:  ::  If-then-else
=/  ::  Pin value to face
=<  ::  Compose with subject on right
=>  ::  Compose with subject on left
^-  ::  Type assertion
%+  ::  Call gate with two arguments
%-  ::  Call gate with one argument
```

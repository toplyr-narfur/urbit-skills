Decision factors: budget (Tlon/Red Horizon free, VPS $6+, managed $20+), technical expertise (managed low, VPS medium, self-hosting high), control needs (self-hosting > VPS > managed), and uptime requirements (managed hosting SLA 99.9-99.99% > VPS 99.9% > self-hosting variable). Best path: Tlon (explore) → VPS (learn) → choose managed (convenience) or self-hosting (privacy/scale).

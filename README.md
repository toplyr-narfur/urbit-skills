# urbit-skills

AI agent skills for Urbit development, operations, and tooling. Follows the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/) open standard.

These skills give coding agents practical knowledge of the Urbit runtime, Hoon programming, Nock assembly, ship deployment, and operational workflows -- solving the problem of AI agents having imperfect understanding of Urbit's unique stack.

## Quick Start

**Claude Code:**
```bash

## Requirements

Skills are self-contained markdown -- no dependencies for knowledge, assistant, or workflow skills. The two interaction skills require:

- **urbit-conn**: `urbit` binary on PATH, `nc` (netcat) for socket communication
- **urbit-terminal**: `screen` or `tmux` with a ship running in a named session
